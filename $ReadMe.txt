This is a dataset of neuronal spiking pattern signals consisting of tonic spike and tonic burst signals. 
•              The dataset contains 50 tonic spike and 50 tonic burst signals. 
•              The sampling rate is 4 KHz, and the signals are generated from a mathematical hyperbolic model of neuronal firing patterns that resemble actual biological recordings.
•              Each signal instance is named by a unique number identifier. For each signal instance, two files are provided: a .dat file including a vector of the signal voltage values in milliVolts (mV), and a .png image file presenting the plot of the signal voltage values in mV with respect to time in milliseconds (ms). 

Complete dataset will be accessible upon acceptance/publication of our paper under consideration for the 2024 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference (IEEE EMBC 2024).
