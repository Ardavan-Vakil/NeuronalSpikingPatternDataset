This is a dataset of neuronal spiking pattern signals consisting of tonic spike and tonic burst signals. 
•	The dataset contains 50 tonic spike and 50 tonic burst signals. 
•	The sampling rate is 4 KHz, and the signals are generated from a mathematical hyperbolic model of neuronal firing patterns that resemble actual biological recordings.
•	Each signal instance is named by a unique number identifier. For each signal instance, two files are provided: a .dat file including a vector of the signal voltage values in milliVolts (mV), and a .png image file presenting the plot of the signal voltage values in mV with respect to time in milliseconds (ms). 

For more information, please refer to our paper titled “Parkinson Disease Burst Pattern Classification via Generative Hyperbolic Neuronal Model” under publication consideration for the 2024 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference (IEEE EMBC 2024). DOI will be provided if/when paper is published.
